# Decarbonizer-App

A disruptive new Blockchain-based Application that empowers users to have an impact by financing clean-tech projects and become part of a collective force developing a decentralized, autonomous organization that facilitates the transition towards resource abundance. 
Our dApp has an integrated wallet that will represent your Mpowa Utility Tokens, Project Tokens and Data tokens.
You can purchase tokens with credit-card or other supported payment methods.Â Tokens will be loaded onto your account after payment, and you can then immediately use them to invest in projects of interest, and eventually consume energy.

As a new user, you will be asked to select your role within the platform environment. For now, let us start with the IMPACTOR profile, which is focussed on participation by the public. An IMPACTOR holds a critical role in funding the right projects and ensuring that the initiative stays true to its mission and purpose. Whilst empowering the public to participate in the transition towards a sustainable future. 
An IMPACTOR navigates through different projects, investigate the details, and facilitate the finance though the MPOWA-tokens, which can be tracked for complete TRANSPARENCY and TRUST. The entire experience is gamified to increase the level of participation, motivation and inclusion.
