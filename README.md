##Backend Development
The user stories that we have completed in the backend development:

1. Authentication & Authorisation: The user will be able to log in using email and password, and all user information will be saved in the database, only admins will be able to view those data. And if an admin needs to add a user using the admin in the database they will be able to accomplish that. 

 There is functionality where an admin can remove a user from the database.

Heroes
You can view the list of heroes that have been added through the database. 
You can add and remove a hero from the database
You can edit Hero information if you would like( only admin)
If different heroes have applied, the admin will choose the best others will not be displayed in the list. 

N:B: If you remove a hero from the database then the user will be removed from the list. 

Project
You can view the list of projects that Mpowa is doing in different countries.
You can add and remove a project from the database if you want. 
You can edit Project information and save the new changes you have made, which will display new data on the list. 

N:B: If you remove a project from the database then it will not show up on the front too, which means the user will not be able to view it. 

Wallet
You can view wallet details, which you can edit, delete and save new changes. 
You can access your private key that shows how much you have received and sent by using a blockchain website (https://www.blockchain.com/). 

N:B: We are still making implementation to make the wallet works as expected.
